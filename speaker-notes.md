## Speaker Notes

Here's what you do.

Explain in 3-minute bursts, because Daisies have incredibly short attention spans. Whenever someone looks like they're spacing out, ask them a question about something you just then explained to them.
Ask for lots of input from the kids, that way they will pay attention and have fun.

## Material

https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/32623476

Go over the project slowly and carefully, explaining things multiple times in different ways.

## Points to hit

How to create sprites
How to detect collisions
How to play the game

Talk about theming the game. How can this game be used "for good"? In other words, how can it help people?

Example of theme: sort the garbage into recycling, compost, and landfill.

## Object

Make a game (starting from nothing) that is "for good", that means it helps people. Mom will go over what "for good" means.

## Backup

If you're short on time, ask kids to adapt existing game (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/781695983) to make it work "for good".
